# Test Fixtures

DSL files used for regression testing.

## Files

- **baseline.dsl**: Minimal RV32I baseline with no constraints
- **simple_outlawed.dsl**: Small set of instruction constraints (data types)

## Purpose

These fixtures are intentionally simple to:
1. Enable fast regression test execution
2. Provide predictable synthesis behavior
3. Test core functionality without complexity
